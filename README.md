# MNDD Nomic

Nomic.html belongs to Matthew Moss. It was downloaded from `http://www.gamecabinet.com/rules/Nomic.html'.
Fair Use applies. We are going to use this in order to play a game of Nomic.

To propose a rule change, submit a pull request.

If your rule change creates a new rule or proposes an amendment or repeal of existing rules,
you should update the rules/ directory appropriate to your proposal.

The proposals/ directory is used for recording the proposals each turn.

Finally, the list of rules which are currently immutable is recorded in the
file immutable_rules.txt

The recommended (but not required) format for rules is:

----
Rule XXX

lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

----

The key features are:
* The rule number at the beginning of the file
* One newline after the rule number
* A trailing newline at the end of the file (but this only costs 0.05 points!)

This format is particularly amenable to "cat rules/*".
