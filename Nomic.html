The rules in the           Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins. The Initial           Set consists of rules 101-116 (immutable) and 201-203 (mutable).<P><H4>102</H4>Initially, rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the           200's are mutable. Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (ie,           changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa) may be           immutable or mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules in           the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.<P><H4>103</H4>A rule change is any of the following:<P><OL><LI>the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule<LI>the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment<LI>the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule, or vice versa</OL><P>           (Note: This definition implies that, at least initially, all new            rules are mutable. Immutable rules, as long as they are            immutable, may not be amended or repealed; mutable rules, as            long as they are mutable, may be amended or repealed. No rule            is absolutely immune to change.)<P><H4>104</H4>            All rule changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.           They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required           number of votes.<P><H4>105</H4> 		   Every player is an eligible voter. Every eligible voter must           participate in every vote on rule changes.<P><H4>106</H4>		   Any proposed rule change must be written down before it is voted           on. If adopted, it must guide play in the form in which it was           voted on.<P><H4>107</H4> No rule change may take effect earlier than the moment of the           completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording           explicitly states otherwise. No rule change may have retroactive           application.<P><H4>108</H4> Each proposed rule change shall be given a rank-order number           (ordinal number) for reference. The numbers shall begin with           301, and each rule change proposed in the proper way shall           receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal           is adopted.<P>           If a rule is repealed and then re-enacted, it receives the           ordinal number of the proposal to re-enact it. If a rule is           amended or transmuted, it receives the ordinal number of the           proposal to amend or transmute it. If an amendment is amended or           repealed, the entire rule of which it is a part receives the           ordinal number of the proposal to amend or repeal the amendment.<P><H4>109</H4> Rule changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules           may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the           eligible voters.<P><H4>110</H4> Mutable rules that are inconsistent in any way with some immutable           rule (except by proposing to transmute it) are wholly void and           without effect. They do not implicitly transmute immutable rules           into mutable rules and at the same time amend them. Rule changes           that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules will be           effective if and only if they explicitly state their transmuting           effect.<P><H4>111</H4> If a rule change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical,           or clearly destructive of play, or if it arguable consists of two           or more rule changes compounded, or is an amendment that makes no           difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable value, then the           other players may suggest amendments or argue against the proposal           before the vote. A reasonable amount of time must be allowed for           this debate. The proponent decides on the final form in which the           proposal is to be voted on and decides the time to end debate and           vote. The only cure for a bad proposal is prevention: a negative           vote.<P><H4>112</H4> The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be changed           from achieving N points to any other state of affairs. However,           the magnitude of N and the means of earning points may be changed,           and rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may           be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.<P><H4>113</H4> A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than           continue to play or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse than           losing, in the judgement of the player to incur it, may be           imposed.<P><H4>114</H4> There must always be at least one mutable rule. The adoption of           rule changes must never become completely impermissible.<P><H4>115</H4> Rules changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule           changes are as permissible as other rule changes. Even rule           changes that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible.           No rule change or type of move is impermissible solely on account           of the self-reference or self-application of a rule.<P><H4>116</H4> Whatever is not explicitly prohibited or regulated by a rule is           permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing           the rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules           explicitly or implicitly permits it.<P><H3>Mutable Rules</H3><H4>201</H4> Players shall alternate in clockwise order, taking one whole           turn apiece. Turns may not be skipped or passed, and parts of           turns may not be omitted. All players begin with zero points.<P><H4>202</H4> One turn consists of two parts, in this order:<OL><LI>proposing one rule change and having it voted on<LI>throwing one die once and adding the number of points on its face to one's score</OL><P><H4>203</H4> A rule change is adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous           among the eligible voters.<P><H4>204</H4> If and when rule changes can be adopted without unanimity, the           players who vote against winning proposals shall receive 10           points apiece.<P><H4>205</H4> An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the           completion of the vote that adopted it.<P><H4>206</H4> When a proposed rule change is defeated, the player who proposed           it loses 10 points.<P><H4>207</H4> Each player has exactly one vote.<P><H4>208</H4> The winner is the first person to achieve 100 (positive) points.<P><H4>209</H4> At no time may there be more than 25 mutable rules.<P><H4>210</H4> Players may not conspire or consult on the making of future rule           changes unless they are teammates.<P><H4>211</H4> If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two           or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule           with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.<P>           If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself           that it defers to another rule (or type or rule) or takes precedence           over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall           supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.<P>           If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to           defer to one another, then the numerical method must again govern.<P><H4>212</H4> If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation           or application of a rule, then the player preceding the one moving is           to be the Judge and to decide the question. Disagreement, for the           purposes of this rule, may be created by the insistence of any player.           Such a process is called <I>invoking judgement</I>.<P>           When judgement has been invoked, the next player may not begin his or           her own turn without the consent of a majority of the other players.<P>           The Judge's judgement may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of           the other players, taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's           judgement is overruled, the player preceding the Judge in the           playing order becomes the new Judge for the question, except that no           player is to be Judge during his own turn or during the turn of a           teammate.<P>           Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising           from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as           to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.<P>           New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges           may, however, settle only those questions on which the players           currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in           which judgement was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in           accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules           are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then           the Judge's only guides shall be common morality, common logic, and           the spirit of the game.<P><H4>213</H4> If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if           the legality of a move is impossible to determine with finality, or           if by the Judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears           equally legal and illegal, then the first player who is unable to           complete a turn is the winner.<P>           This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the           winner.<P><P>See also the <A HREF="http://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~michael/games/nomic/">Nomic</A> pages maintained by Michael Norrish.</P><P><A HREF="../">The Game Cabinet</A> -  <A HREF="mailto:editor@gamecabinet.com">editor@gamecabinet.com</A>- <A HREF="../biography/KenTidwell.html">Ken Tidwell</A></P><script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">_uacct = "UA-1707666-1";urchinTracker();</script></body></HTML>
