Rule 202


One turn consists of two parts, in this order:

* proposing one rule change and having it voted on
* score points: subtract 291 from the ordinal number of the
  proposal and multiply the result by the fraction of favorable
  votes it received, rounded to the nearest integer.

(This yields a number between 0 and 10 for the first player,
with the upper limit increasing by one each turn; more points
are awarded for more popular proposals.)
