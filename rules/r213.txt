Rule 213

If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if
the legality of a move is impossible to determine with finality, or
if by the Judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears
equally legal and illegal, then the first player who is unable to
complete a turn is the winner.

This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the
winner.
