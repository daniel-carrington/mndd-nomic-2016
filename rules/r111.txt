Rule 111


If a rule change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical,
or clearly destructive of play, or if it arguable consists of two
or more rule changes compounded, or is an amendment that makes no
difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable value, then the
other players may suggest amendments or argue against the proposal
before the vote. A reasonable amount of time must be allowed for
this debate. The proponent decides on the final form in which the
proposal is to be voted on and decides the time to end debate and
vote. The only cure for a bad proposal is prevention: a negative
vote.
