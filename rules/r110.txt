Rule 110


Mutable rules that are inconsistent in any way with some immutable
rule (except by proposing to transmute it) are wholly void and
without effect. They do not implicitly transmute immutable rules
into mutable rules and at the same time amend them. Rule changes
that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules will be
effective if and only if they explicitly state their transmuting
effect.
