Rule 112


The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be changed
from achieving N points to any other state of affairs. However,
the magnitude of N and the means of earning points may be changed,
and rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may
be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.
