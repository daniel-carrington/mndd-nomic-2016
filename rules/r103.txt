Rule 103


A rule change is any of the following:

* the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule
* the enactment, repeal, or amendment of an amendment
* the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule, or vice versa

(Note: This definition implies that, at least initially, all new
rules are mutable. Immutable rules, as long as they are
immutable, may not be amended or repealed; mutable rules, as
long as they are mutable, may be amended or repealed. No rule
is absolutely immune to change.)
