Rule 301

When the total cost of all rules changes, the player who proposed
the change of the rules, adds the integer value of the old cost of
the rules minus the new cost of the rules to their point total.

When this rule is adopted, the proposer of this rule loses exactly 12 points
instead of any penalty that may or may not be implied by the previous clause.

All rules must be bodies of plain text written in ASCII.

The cost of a rule is equal to the sum of the base cost of the rule
plus all bonus costs which apply to the rule.

An immutability bonus of 20 points applies to
all immutable rules as a bonus cost.

A bonus cost must increase the cost of a rule and
may not decrease the cost of a rule.

The base cost of a rule is equal to the sum of a point value for each ASCII character
in the text of the rule, rounded up to the nearest integer.
Refer to each clause in the list, in the order below, to determine the
cost of a character. The first clause which applies takes precedence.

* 0.05 points for every LF character, byte value 0x0a.
* 0 points for every CR, byte value 0x0d
* 0.5 points for every ', byte value 0x27, for every ;, byte value 0x3b
* 0 points for any other whitespace, up to the first 2000 characters, and after that 0.02 points
* 0.02 points for every ", byte value 0x22
* 0.1 points for any of the characters after the colon:%&(){}[]\-#
* 0 points for every other ASCII character, up to the first 100 characters, and after that 0.02 points
