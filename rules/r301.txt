Rule 301

When the total cost of all rules changes, the player who proposed
the change of the rules shall add the integer value of the old cost of
the rules minus the new cost of the rules to their point total.
When this rule is adopted, the proposer of this rule loses exactly 12 points
instead of being penalized as described earlier in this rule.
All rules must be bodies of plain text written in ASCII.

The cost of a rule is equal to the sum of the base cost of the rule
plus all bonus costs which apply to the rule. A bonus cost must be a
positive integer and therefore strictly increases the cost of a rule.

An immutability bonus of 20 points applies to all immutable rules as a bonus cost.

The base cost of a rule is equal to the sum of a point value for each ASCII character
in the text of the rule, rounded up to the nearest integer.
Refer to each clause in the list, in the order below, to determine the
cost of a character. The first clause which applies takes precedence.

* 0.05 points for every LF character, byte value 0x0a.
* 0 points for every CR, byte value 0x0d
* 0.5 points for every ', byte value 0x27, for every ;, byte value 0x3b
* 0 points for any other whitespace, up to the first 2000 characters, and after that 0.02 points
* 0.02 points for every ", byte value 0x22
* 0.1 points for any of the characters after the colon:%&(){}[]\-#
* 0 points for every other ASCII character, up to the first 100 characters, and after that 0.02 points
