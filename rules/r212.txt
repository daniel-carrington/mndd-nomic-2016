Rule 212


If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation
or application of a rule, then the player preceding the one moving is
to be the Judge and to decide the question. Disagreement, for the
purposes of this rule, may be created by the insistence of any player.
Such a process is called invoking judgement.

When judgement has been invoked, the next player may not begin his or
her own turn without the consent of a majority of the other players.

The Judge's judgement may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of
the other players, taken before the next turn is begun. If a Judge's
judgement is overruled, the player preceding the Judge in the
playing order becomes the new Judge for the question, except that no
player is to be Judge during his own turn or during the turn of a
teammate.

Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising
from the game until the next turn is begun, including questions as
to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.

New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. New Judges
may, however, settle only those questions on which the players
currently disagree and that affect the completion of the turn in
which judgement was invoked. All decisions by Judges shall be in
accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules
are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then
the Judge's only guides shall be common morality, common logic, and
the spirit of the game.
